# Useful Utilities
 EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that contains various gameplay changes and configurations.

# Features
- Option to add SCP-096 back to the regular spawn pool, no matter how many players are on the server.
  - Players who have their SCP-096 preference in the red by any amount will not be forced to switch
  - Only recommended for servers with very small player bases
- Option to disable the announcement when a Chaos Insurgency wave spawns
- More coming soon

# Notes
- See your EXILED config for options to change specific gamemode settings. (Make sure you run the server at least once with the plugin so the configs generate.)
